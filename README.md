# Weather App

It's a Functional Web Application Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Overview
This web application allows users to check the current weather conditions in any city by fetching real-time data from a weather API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app utilizes asynchronous programming to handle API data, dynamic DOM manipulation, and responsive layout design with Flexbox.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Programming**:  
  The app uses the `fetch()` API to retrieve weather data asynchronously, ensuring a smooth user experience without page reloads.
  
- **Weather Data Fetching**:  
  Users can input any city, and the app will display real-time weather information such as:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind speed
  - Weather description
  
- **Responsive Layout**:  
  Flexbox is used to structure and arrange content effectively, making the app responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
- **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**:  
  Using `document.getElementById()`, the app dynamically updates the UI based on the fetched weather data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**:  
  Markup structure of the application.
  
- **CSS**:  
  Styling and layout using Flexbox for responsive design.
  
- **JavaScript**:  
  Fetching weather data via API, manipulating the DOM, and handling user input.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:  
   The user enters the name of a city into the search bar.

2. **API Call**:  
   The app makes an API request to a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) using JavaScript's `fetch()` function.

3. **Data Display**:  
   Once the data is retrieved, the app dynamically updates the page to display the weather information for the city.

4. **Responsive Design**:  
   The layout adjusts seamlessly on different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across devices.
