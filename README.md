# Weather-App

It's a Functional Web Application Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Overview
This web application allows users to check the current weather conditions in any city by fetching real-time data from a weather API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app utilizes asynchronous programming to handle API data, dynamic DOM manipulation, and responsive layout design with Flexbox.

Key Features

Asynchronous Programming: The app uses the fetch() API to retrieve weather data asynchronously, ensuring a smooth user experience without page reloads.
Weather Data Fetching: Users can input any city, and the app will display real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.
Responsive Layout: Flexbox is used to structure and arrange content effectively, making the app responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.
Dynamic DOM Manipulation: Using document.getElementById(), the app dynamically updates the UI based on the fetched weather data.

Technologies Used

HTML: Markup structure of the application.
CSS: Styling and layout using Flexbox for responsive design.
JavaScript: Fetching weather data via API, manipulating the DOM, and handling user input.

How It Works

User Input: The user enters the name of a city into the search bar.
API Call: The app makes an API request to a weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) using JavaScript's fetch() function.
Data Display: Once the data is retrieved, the app dynamically updates the page to display the weather information for the city.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts seamlessly on different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across devices.
